## Implementation Plan for Error Handling

Below is a step-by-step plan to unify and fully implement your error handling approach across the codebase, focusing on replacing or enhancing any inconsistent areas. The goal is to ensure all parts of the application—UI, data fetching, and APIs—rely on the same, centralized error handling system.

---

### 1. Standardize the Custom Error Hierarchy

• Consolidate existing files that define custom error classes into a single location.  
• Make the primary file the canonical source of error definitions such as a base error class plus subclasses for authentication, validation, network, etc.  
• Ensure all features (authentication, forms, network requests) rely on these classes for throwing or wrapping errors.

---

### 2. Ensure React Error Boundary Usage Is Consistent

• Apply the ErrorBoundary component in critical layout areas to capture any unhandled render or lifecycle errors.  
• Wrap major layout sections or routes with the ErrorBoundary.  
• Decide how the ErrorBoundary interacts with any existing global error context (e.g., remove duplication or use them for different purposes).

---

### 3. Remove or Integrate the Error Context

• If a global error context exists, decide whether it remains necessary after introducing a robust error boundary and toast-based notification system.  
• If you preserve it, rename it or narrow its scope to specific error use cases (like storing user-facing validation messages).  
• Otherwise, remove it to simplify.

---

### 4. Integrate React Query Error Management

• In all useQuery and useMutation calls, convert unknown or Supabase errors to the same standardized error class hierarchy.  
• Surface errors through a global toast or logging mechanism, ensuring consistent user feedback.

---

### 5. Unify API Route Error Responses

• Wrap logic in Next.js route handlers with try/catch.  
• Convert all thrown errors to your standardized error class for consistent handling.  
• Respond with uniform JSON error messages, including status codes.  
• Log errors with context but avoid exposing sensitive data.

---

### 6. Standardize Toast Notifications

• For user-facing errors, display toast messages rather than raw console logs.  
• Use a single helper to transform unknown errors into standardized messages.  
• Provide a fallback message when the system lacks a more specific error description.

---

### 7. Clean Up Inconsistent Legacy Approaches

• Replace existing console error calls, setError patterns, or custom error logs with the new, consolidated system.  
• Remove outdated error classes that duplicate or conflict with the new ones.  
• Ensure all error throwing aligns with the official custom error classes.

---

### 8. Testing & Verification

• Verify the ErrorBoundary’s fallback UI in development by deliberately throwing an error.  
• Write or update tests for your error-handling utility, confirming it wraps unknown errors into a standardized format.  
• Confirm API routes return consistent JSON responses with appropriate status codes.  
• Check React Query flows to ensure the correct toast messages appear on errors.

---

## Conclusion

Following these steps will align your codebase with the robust error handling plan. By centralizing error classes, using a single error boundary for UI failures, employing consistent onError callbacks in React Query, and returning uniform API responses, your application will be more maintainable, secure, and user-friendly.
